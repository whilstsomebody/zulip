# Searching for messages

It's easy to find the right conversation with Zulip's powerful search. When you
find the message you were looking for, go directly to its topic for full context.

Whenever you need a reminder of the search filters that Zulip offers, check out
the convenient [**search filters**](#search-filters-reference) reference
in the Zulip web and desktop apps.

## Keyword search

Zulip lets you search messages and topics by keyword. For example:

* `new logo`: Search for messages with both `new` and `logo` in the message or
  its topic.
* `"new logo"`: Search for messages with the phrase "`new logo`" in the message
  or its topic.

Some details to keep in mind:

- Keywords are case-insensitive, so `wave` will also match `Wave`.
- Zulip will find messages containing similar keywords (keywords with the same
  stem), so, e.g., `wave` will match `waves` and `waving`.
- Zulip search ignores very common words like `a`, `the`, and about 100 others.
- [Emoji](/help/emoji-and-emoticons) in messages (but not [emoji
  reactions](/help/emoji-reactions)) are included in searches, so if you search
  for `thumbs_up`, your results will include messages with the `:thumbs_up:` emoji (üëç).

## Search filters

Zulip also offers a wide array of search filters, which can be used on their
own, or in combination with keywords. For example:

* `channel:design`: Navigate to **#design**.
* `channel:design logo`: Search for the keyword `logo` within **#design**.
* `channel:design has:image new logo`: Search for messages in **#design** that
  include an image and contain the keywords `new` and `logo`. The keywords can
  appear in the message itself or its topic.

    As you start typing into the search box, Zulip will suggest search filters
    you can use.

### Search by location

Sometimes you know approximately where the message you are looking for was sent.
Zulip offers the following filters based on the location of the message.

* `channel:design`: Search within the channel **#design**.
* `channel:design topic:new+logo`: Search within the topic "new logo" in
  **#design**.
* `is:dm`: Search all your direct messages.
* `dm:Bo Lin`: Search 1-on-1 direct messages between you and Bo.
* `dm:Bo Lin, Elena Garc√≠a`: Search group direct messages
  between you, Bo, and Elena.

  (1-on-1 and group) that include you and Bo, as well as any other users.
* `channels:public`: Search the history of all [public
  channels](/help/change-the-privacy-of-a-channel) in the organization, including
  channels you are not subscribed to; see details
  [below](#search-shared-history).
* `channels:archived`: Search the history of [archived
  channels](/help/archive-a-channel#archive-a-channel_1) in the organization.

### Search shared history

To avoid cluttering your search results, by default, Zulip searches just the
messages you received. You can use `channels:` or `channel:` filters to search
additional messages.

* `channels:public`: Search messages in all
  [public](/help/channel-permissions#public-channels) and
  [web-public](/help/channel-permissions#web-public-channels) channels.
* `channels:web-public`: Search messages in all
  [web-public](/help/change-the-privacy-of-a-channel) channels in the organization,
  including channels you are not subscribed to.
* `channel:design`: Search all messages in **#design**, including messages sent
  before you were a subscriber.

### Search by sender

* `sender:Elena Garc√≠a`: Search messages sent by Elena.
* `sender:me`: Search messages you've sent.

!!! tip ""

    You can also access all messages someone has sent [via their **user
    card**](/help/view-messages-sent-by-a-user).

### Search for attachments or links

* `has:link`: Search messages that contain URLs.
* `has:attachment`: Search messages that contain an [uploaded
  file](/help/share-and-upload-files).
* `has:image`: Search messages that contain uploaded or linked images or videos.

    You can also [view](/help/manage-your-uploaded-files) all the files you
    have uploaded or [browse](/help/view-images-and-videos) all the images and
    videos in the current view.

### Search your important messages

* `is:alerted`: Search messages that contain your [alert
  words](/help/dm-mention-alert-notifications#alert-words). Messages are
  included in the search results based on the alerts you had configured when you
  received the message.
* `is:mentioned`: Search messages where you were
  [mentioned](/help/mention-a-user-or-group).

  both muted and unmuted messages are included in keyword search results.
* `has:reaction`: Search messages with [emoji reactions](/help/emoji-reactions).

### Search by message ID

Each message in Zulip has a unique ID, which is used for [linking to a specific
message](/help/link-to-a-message-or-conversation#link-to-zulip-from-anywhere).
You can use the search bar to navigate to a message by its ID.

* `near:12345`: Show messages around the message with ID `12345`.
* `id:12345`: Show only message `12345`.
* `channel:design near:1` Show the oldest messages in the **#design** channel.

### Exclude filters

All of Zulip's search filters can be negated to **exclude** messages matching
the specified rule. For example:

- `channel:design -is:resolved -has:image`: Search messages in [unresolved
  topics](/help/resolve-a-topic) in the **#design** channel that don't contain
  images.

## Linking to search results

When you search Zulip, the URL shown in the address bar of the Zulip web app is a
permanent link to your search. You can share this link with others, and they
will see *their own* search results for your query.
